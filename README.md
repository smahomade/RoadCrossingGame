## About
Mobile games are very popular then ever, giving me the chance to create a small Unity game using finger touch responsive touch. This is a basic road crossing game, self exaplanitory and gets progressivly difficult, adding different vehicles as the game goes. I completed the Zenva Course but also progressed the game, adding a menu, levels, increase difficulty and etc.

## Instructions
1. Can be played on the PC using the mouse but also has finger responsive which allows you to play on the Phone. 
2. Can only Swipe Up, Left and Right
3. Complete certain condition to make it to the next level (Obtain n amount of coins)

Note: Please go to the Zenva Course if you would like to make a similar game.
